        <h3>About the CIBM Community Map</h3>
        <p>
            The CIBM Community Map visualizes the network of experts in the field of biomedical imaging, promoting
            interaction within and beyond the founding partner institutions. The map shows the locations of CIBM Core
            members, who are involved in daily activities such as research, teaching, and service, as well as Affiliate
            and Associate members collaborating through joint projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            By interacting with the map, you can explore the connections and collaborations within the CIBM Community.
            Click on institution markers to see the researchers associated with that institution. Use the filters to
            view researchers by their specialized modules: MRI, EEG, SP, DS, and PET.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose of this Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this visualization is to showcase the CIBM community and the people working together. CIBM
            constitutes a network of well-recognized experts in the field of biomedical imaging and promotes interaction
            within and beyond the founding partner institutions. The members of the CIBM Community are researchers,
            scientists, engineers, technicians, and clinicians from academia, industry, and hospitals in Switzerland and
            throughout the globe. The CIBM Core members are those who are leading and involved in the day-to-day
            activities of the Center such as research, teaching, and service by providing their expertise and access to
            the CIBM infrastructure. The CIBM Affiliate and Associate members are those closely collaborating with CIBM
            Core members through joint projects, PhD supervision, and grants. The CIBM Affiliate members include
            students and employees affiliated with the five founding partner institutions CHUV, UNIL, EPFL, UNIGE, and
            HUG, whereas the CIBM Associate members are students and employees affiliated with other partner
            institutions. The CIBM Alumni members are all past CIBM Core members.

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)</strong>: A technique that uses strong magnetic fields and
                radio waves to generate detailed images of the organs and tissues in the body.</li>
            <li><strong>EEG (Electroencephalography)</strong>: A method to record electrical activity of the brain using
                sensors placed on the scalp.</li>
            <li><strong>SP (Signal Processing)</strong>: The analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals.
                Signals can be audio, video, temperature, etc., often used in various forms of data analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>DS (Data Science)</strong>: A multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes,
                algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.</li>
            <li><strong>PET (Positron Emission Tomography)</strong>: An imaging test that helps reveal how your tissues
                and organs are functioning, using a radioactive drug (tracer) to show this activity.</li>
        </ul>
